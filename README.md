# Chatbot User Profile Handler

This project is for the **Week 2 Assignment: Building a Chatbot's User Profile Handler** for course ITEC 5025.

It features a command-line chatbot that demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including data types, type conversion, and various operators.

## Features
- **User Greeting**: Welcomes the user and explains functionality.
- **Profile Creation**: Collects user name (string), age (int), height (float), and student status (boolean). Includes error handling for invalid inputs.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Performs basic calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) based on user input.
- **Comparison**: Compares two numbers to check for equality and relative size.
- **Logic Checks**: detailed logical conditions (`and`, `or`, `not`) to provide "product recommendations" based on the user's profile.
